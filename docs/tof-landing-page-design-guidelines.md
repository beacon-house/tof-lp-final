# Beacon House TOF Landing Page - Design Guidelines

## Context
This document defines design specifications for the **Top of Funnel (TOF) landing page** targeting parents exploring undergraduate education options. This page has a softer, empathy-driven tone compared to the results-focused MOF page (apply.beaconhouse.in).

**Base Brand Guidelines:** Refer to `lead-gen-landing-page-design-guidelines.md` for complete color codes, typography, and core design system.

## Design Philosophy for TOF Page

**Principle:** Calm clarity over confident assertion.

The visual design should feel:
- Spacious and breathable (not dense)
- Warm and approachable (not corporate)
- Supportive and guiding (not selling)
- Premium but accessible (not intimidating)

---

## Color Usage Adaptations

**Primary Colors:** (Same as main brand)
- Navy: `#003366`
- Gold: `#FDB71A`
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Light Gray: `#F5F5F5`

**Application Changes:**
- **More white space dominance** - sections should be predominantly white/light gray
- **Navy as accent** - use for key headers and footer, not full section backgrounds
- **Gold for CTA only** - keep CTA buttons prominent but reduce gold elsewhere
- **Softer section breaks** - use subtle gray backgrounds instead of full navy blocks

---

## Typography Hierarchy

**Fonts:** (Same as main brand)
- **UI/Body:** Inter (400, 500, 600, 700)
- **Editorial/Headers:** Merriweather (400, 700) - use sparingly for emotional beats

**Size/Weight Adjustments:**
- **H1 (Hero):** 48px (mobile: 32px) - slightly smaller than MOF page
- **H2 (Sections):** 36px (mobile: 28px) - more conversational scale
- **Body:** 18px (mobile: 16px) - comfortable reading size
- **Line height:** 1.6-1.8 (more generous than MOF's 1.5)

**Tone via Typography:**
- Use **Merriweather for empathetic statements** (e.g., "If you're a parent, this will feel familiar:")
- Use **Inter for informational content** (lists, facts, process steps)
- Avoid all-caps except for small labels
- Use sentence case for headers, not title case

---

## Layout & Spacing

**Section Padding:**
- Desktop: 80-100px vertical (vs MOF's 60-80px)
- Mobile: 60px vertical

**Content Width:**
- Max 1200px container
- Text blocks: 700px max width for readability

**Breathing Room:**
- Generous margins between sections
- Single-column focus on mobile
- 2-column max on desktop (avoid 3+ column density)

---

## Imagery Guidelines

**Style:**
- Warm, human-focused photography
- Parent-student interaction moments preferred
- Natural lighting, soft focus
- Avoid overly corporate/stock imagery

**Usage:**
- Hero: Large, emotionally resonant image (right side on desktop)
- Sections: Subtle background images or none
- No busy patterns or textures

---

## Component Styling

### CTA Buttons
- **Primary (Book a Call):** Gold `#FDB71A`, navy text, 48px height
- **Secondary (soft CTAs):** Navy outline, white background
- **Hover:** Slightly darker gold, subtle lift
- Rounded corners: 8px
- Text: Inter 600, 16px

### Cards/Sections
- White background with subtle shadow: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
- 16px border-radius
- 32px padding (desktop), 24px (mobile)
- No heavy borders

### Stats Display
- Less prominent than MOF page
- Smaller font sizes
- Supportive context, not hero feature
- Use inline with text, not separate callout blocks

### Navigation
- Clean, minimal header
- Logo + 4 key links max
- Sticky on scroll
- White background with subtle shadow

---

## UX Patterns

**Page Flow:**
- Continuous, single-flow design (no alternating section backgrounds)
- Use white as primary background throughout
- Light gray `#F5F5F5` only for subtle separation where needed (max 1-2 sections)
- Avoid busy alternating patterns that look AI-generated

**Visual Rhythm:**
- Content naturally separated by generous whitespace (80-100px vertical padding)
- Subtle dividers or shadows if needed, not background color changes
- Maintain reading flow without jarring transitions

**Section Structure:**
- Clean, linear progression from hero to final CTA
- Each section stands alone without competing backgrounds
- Use typography hierarchy for separation, not color blocks

**Navigation:**
- Minimal, clean header that stays out of the way
- Single, clear CTA per section
- Smooth scroll behavior between sections

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768-1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

**Mobile Priorities:**
- Stack everything single column
- Larger tap targets (min 44px)
- Readable text without zoom (16px minimum)
- Hero image below headline on mobile
- Simplified navigation (hamburger if needed)
