If you’re a parent, this will feel familiar:

* Too many opinions

This is a **direction** problem.

In today’s admissions world, what matters is:

* real strengths  
* curiosity and initiative  
* depth over activity-collecting  
* clarity of direction  
* a story that makes sense

**Admissions teams reward clarity.**
